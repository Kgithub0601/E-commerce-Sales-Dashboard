# Madhav-E-commerce-Sales-Dashboard
In this project, i have made an intractive Power BI Sales Dashboard on Madhav E-commerce sales data and found out some meaningful insights from the data. In order to build an interactive and innovative dashboard the ETL process was done as per the requirements, Power query was used to clean and transform the data.
After the compeletion of the ELT process the transformed highly meaningful data was further brought down to create a creative interactive report by using different graphs, charts and  slicers etc,which helped in understanding the data in a more easier way and to find out useful insights for the same.
Once, the whole data visualisation was done and the final report was made
